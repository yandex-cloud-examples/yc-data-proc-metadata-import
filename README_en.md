# Transferring metadata between Yandex Data Processing clusters through Hive Metastore

With Metastore, you can export your metadata from a Data Processing cluster and import it into another one. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc/tutorials/metastore-import) to learn how to set up the solution with Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [metastore-import.tf](metastore-import.tf).
